# Urban_Mobility_Insights_Predictive_Traffic_Analysis

This code repository demonstrates a machine learning approach for forecasting traffic patterns. It includes data preprocessing, feature selection using Decision Trees Classifier, and the usage of XGBoost for prediction.  
As a data scientist working with the government to transform our city into a smart city, I aim to enhance traffic management and infrastructure planning. Understanding traffic patterns at the four junctions, including holidays and special occasions, is crucial for forecasting and preparing for traffic peaks effectively.
